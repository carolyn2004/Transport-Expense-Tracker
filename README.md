# Transport-Expense-Tracker ðŸ’°
  - In this mini-project I learnt about how to make a flutter mobile application linked to google cloud firebase. 
  - I also made use of this knowledge and implemented this knowledge in my final project linked here: https://github.com/carolyn2004/My-Plate 
  - Users can use this application to keep track of their expenses.
  - They can perform CRUD operations. They can add an expense and read it in list view, delete it and update it.
